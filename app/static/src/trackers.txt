Tennis: Tracking the Trackers

The idea that match statistics can produce insights that will improve performance inevitably presents itself somewhere in the arc of discovery that is the life of a tennis player.

Of course such claims are practically pedestrian… IBM, SAP and other large companies with data processing prowess to proffer advertise their capabilities and services via Grand Slam events.. and anyone who follows tennis even casually will be aware of products such as PlaySight and Mojjo. 

The first thing that anyone does these days when inspired to dig deeper on any subject is assume “there must be an app for that” and launch a search, and that’s where things get interesting, or, more likely, confusing!

It can be overwhelming and even painful to wade through the dozens of apps related in some way to playing tennis. The App and Play Store reviews are rarely helpful and even sometimes suspicious and the cobbled together articles purporting to review such apps are frequently specious — I’ve actually confirmed with several authors that they never actually used the apps in their ‘Top Ten’ lists.
