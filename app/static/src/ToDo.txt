STATBROWSER
stat for # of matches vs. # of opponents.  People higher on the tour would tend to face the same players more often...?

for graphs that appear below parallel coordinates, each time one is generated cache the data
   ... such that when the same graph is generated for a *different* player, the two can be compared

ladderChart FILTERS
change the interaction between the datePicker and the surface filters so that when a surface has been filtered the datePicker selects for only that surface...

GEO
Map of Croatia and surrounding countries when scroll through date ranges show tournament locations shape/color for U12-18/surface
Show lines for date "flows" -> Sankey diagrams overlaid on maps... in fact, use the animated Sankeys! Thickness of line going IN to a tournament can indicate Draw Size

NEW GRAPHS
Opponents over time
Win Ratio vs. Opponents over time

tournament dominance ratio... what percentage of games won as tournament progresses
... graph all players showing win percentage on Y axis and sets on X axis

CourtHive menu to sidebar

LOGINS
Support for cookies and user logins

PLAYER BIOGRAPHICAL INFO

Head to Head (Head2Head)
Along with LadderChart (Tournament Outcomes) a chart where it is possible to rank opponents by # times faced / win %
How to compare all opponents with respect to various aggregate stats for that opponent?
   --> show Stat browser with stats vs. Opponents instead of stats for Matches !!!

Chart which shows win/loss over time vs all opponents.  no time scale.  1st/2nd/3rd/etc encounter up/down. 
Perhaps a set of progression patterns...  So you can see collection of opponents with the same win/loss progression.
Kind of like a sideways GameTree / Sankey flows...

Graphic to compare height, weight, age, rank and globe/map for origin

LADDER CHART
Menu options to filter chart based on opponent
Surface filters appear as colored circles near the top right... Hovering over them initiates dynamic transition!
Transition is of both Ladder Chart and the Parallel Coordinates Chart of Statistics...

PARALLEL COORDINATES
add this ability to handle situations where there is more/less data
https://bocoup.com/weblog/showing-missing-data-in-line-charts

PTS CHART
ptsChart needs to understand Super Tie-breaks
Indicate player who made winners/errors by starting the color from top to bottom for player one and vice versa for player two. 
If no rally (length 0) use gradients from red to white or green to white...

TOURNAMENT GLOBE
Wrap the order of the tournaments in a line that girdles (or runs across the face of) the globe
perhaps the line changes color over time, so the beginning of a player's chart is one color and changes moving forward in time
When the globe is rotated the tournaments on the ladder chart are highlighted when they are "in view"...

When viewing a specific tournament show on globe then show where players originated from
But Also, where the players traveled from... the last match at the last tournament... 
the connecting line can be color coded to show the time for travel between tournaments.  If short, red, if long, green.
Also take time zone changes into account...

SUNBURST
think about replacing or augmenting Sunburst view with this example...

CourtHive
Window resizing not implemented for PTS / Momentum
resizing for elements doesn't take into consideration the width of the side menu, so Overview and StatView are off-screen a bit

RALLYTREE
when there are no rallies > length 3, don't show RallyTree
when there are Super Tie-breaks and no RallyTree, show a GameFish for third set

overlay for RallyTree such that hovering over a particular ROW on either side give the # of points and rally length.
scope stats to a selected ROW.

Also include an optional popup chart at the bottom like in STA METHOD y-axis is # of points x-axis is divided into rally-ranges
1-2, 3-4, 5-8, 8+

PARALLEL COORDINATES
shows up just below ladderChart
- displays stats for all player matches
- can be filtered by surface

SEARCH
- tournament search

TOURNAMENT HORIZON CHART ORDERING:
Viktor Troicki Sydney 2016 SF/F are out of order, both happen on the same date
—> need to sort by ROUND if matches occur on the same day…

When match.status == retired, default, walkover
set 'won' attribute in buildMatchList by match.winner

NEW VIZ:
*. Sanja - progression of i.e. serve throughout the match
   --> enabled moving average which can be overlayed on momentum chart
   ---> like the Tennis Comstat reports!

GAMETREE.JS
use GameTree to scope stats (same as brushing Horizon Chart).
   - scope by serving player
   - scope by clicking a specific point progression

STATISTICS.JS
Statistics: don't count 'point won' in stars for 1st serve or security 2nd serve & etc.
*** Receiving Points Won 2nd has an incorrect % calculation

STATVIEW.JS
Aggressive Margin should have a maximum width
Bars should have a more intelligent split when there are comparisons of Percentages
-> Perhaps total percentages (as if they were whole numbers) and show each percentage as percentage of the total
--> Player AVERAGE stats can be shown as a slightly thicker bar behind each stat

MCPS.JS
Player Initials cell can get too big (JMDP - Juan Martin del Portro) and throws other columns off...
either auto-resize the rest of the spreadsheet, or auto-shrink the size of the characters in this column

PARSERS.JS
implement PTF Doubles Matches parsing
implement shot codes for MTS parsing

MATCHOBJECT.JS
August Allen_Luca Stella_7-Jun-2015.ptf tiebreak_at sets to 3 not implemented...

METADATA.JS
when retrieve a player name, also retrieve bio info so that e.g. hand can be set automatically

MEDIA
Solicit public domain images and links to articles about specific matches
as well as Twitter, Facebook & website links for specific players
as part of 'crowdsourcing'

//////////////////////////// BUGS: /////////////////////////////
http://localhost:8080/new/CourtHive/devel.html?timeline=9901519
statview has breakpoints won as 150% and breakpoints saved as -50%
Is it because there are no advantages?

Tennis Scoreboard 57G
Match Scores don't match
15:10:38 15 - 0 Score is removed...
points.split(8,1) to remove the offending point...

Tennis Scoreboard 970
Final set is a Super Tie-break and stands at 2-0
BUT the tiebreak score is shown both as 2T-0T and 2-0.  Need to display 10-? when COMPLETE, but otherwise 2T-0T.

Tennis Scoreboard 6AJ
There are two points which are invalid because they are incomplete
REASON: Game log is nonsensical.
FIX NEEDED: Check games scores are well ordered


TESTING PLAN:
Each type of file
Each type of match
Each type of point entry "MCP" 0/1 and S/P/Q/R
Change each metadata setting, then change back to see if data preserved

----------SERVER------------

when files mailed to the server are parsed, owner gets an email back with confirmation and an URL to view the match.
   - they should also be given the opportunity to create an account to authorize:
      - future editing of the match data
        - identifying players and tying them to their [i.e. TennisEurope] identity
        - specifying additional information about the match, venue gps coordinates & etc.


-----------TOURNAMENT APPLICATION-------------

TOURNAMENT APPLICATION:
Match scores for any number of games
Allows adjusting game or point score at any time -- a UMO behind each so it's possible to enter tracking mode for any match at any time.
Automagically constructs draw based on round information and player names.
Broadcasts all information to publicly accessible tournament page.
