PARSING NOTES:

SBA

Columns A+J: G, P, L are redundant because Point Won, Lost or Missed is obvious from rest of code
        B+I    --> assuming these redundant codes are used in 'database' calculations
               --> spreadsheet 'COUNTIF' statements don't separate numbers from letters, so high redundancy.
           : Service court can be inferred from game context, i.e. game score at each point.

Column L   : Does the Rally # include the serve; return of serve?

Shot Codes:

Trailing numbers can always be ignored because they're redundant, either deuce/ad or 1st/2nd serve

H           => indicates a Forehand return winner or forcing error
G           => indicates a Backhand return shot in all but 4 cases: 1SV0G, 2SV0G, CAG, RAG
            => indicates a winner or forcing error in all but 5 cases: 1SV0G, 2SV0G, CCG, CAG, RAG
            => always indicates a return winner or forcing error when BEGINS with G

RRV         => always indicates a return winner or forcing error  ==> RRV can be replaced with G
RCD         => always indicates a return winner or forcing error  ==> RCD can be replaced with H

CE - can be ignored if RRV/RCD replaced with G/H because G/H by themselves indicate Center
CR - can be replaced with C if RRV/RCD replaced
DC - can be replaced with D if RRV/RCD replaced
DL - can be replaced with P if RRV/RCD replaced

1-6         => starts with serve placement, always a winner of forcing error by server on 3rd rally shot (2nd server shot);

S2-S4       => 'ends with' => Winner or forcing error by server
R2-R4       => 'ends with' => Winner or forcing error by receiver

~2          => 3-4 shot rally
~3          => 5-8 shot rally
~4          =>  >8 shot rally

A           => always indicates a drop shot
P           => for Forehand (C) and Backhand (R) indicates a passing shot in all but two cases, VCP and VRP, where it indicates topspin
            => for Return Forehand (G) and Return Backhand (H) indicates Inside-In
D           => for Return Forehand (G) and Return Backhand (H) indicates Inside-Out

CC && !CCL - Forehand cross court
CP - Forehand Passing Shot
CPC - Forehand Passing Shot Cross
CPL - Forehand Passing Shot Line
CPE - Forehand Passing Shot Body
CE - Forehand Center
DE - Forehand inside-center
DC - Forehand inside-out
DL - Forehand inside-in
CCC - Forehand cross on short ball
CCL - Forehand line on short ball
Forehand (C) with 2nd C = cross court
Forehand (C) with 3rd C = short ball

RS - Backhand Slice
RC & !RCL - Backhand cross court
RP - Backhand Passing Shot
RPC - Backhand Passing Shot Cross

G - center
GL - down line
GC - cross
GD - inside out
GP - inside in

TL          => always indicates a lob
T & !TL     => always indicates 'touch'

$V          => ends with 'V' indicates 'to the net' in all but six cases: 1SV, 2SV, 3SV, 4SV, 5SV, 6SV
V && !$V && !RRV  => indicates 'Serve & Volley in all but ["VS2", "VS3", "VS4", "VR2", "VR3", "VR4", "VS", "VR"]


RCDDC, HD, RCDDL, HP => all indicate the same thing: "First or Second Serve Forehand Return Inside Out Winner or that Provoke the Rival Error"

THEREFORE:

C,D,E & G,H,I
Unless the code is one character (1,2,3,4,5,6) then:
   - remove all leading digits
   - if doesn't start with a digit then remove all TRAILING S2, S3, S4 & R2, R3, R4 (redundant) and STORE Rally Length (2 = 3-4, 3 = 5-8, 4 = >8)
   - if starts with S, remove the S (confusing)
   - remove all trailing digits
   - replace RRV with G
   - replace RCD with H
